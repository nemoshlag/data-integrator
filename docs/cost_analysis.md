## 6. Decision Factors Beyond Cost

### 6.1 Technical Considerations
```yaml
dynamodb_advantages:
  - Zero operational overhead
  - Automatic scaling
  - Global tables for multi-region
  - No connection management

postgresql_advantages:
  - Complex query support
  - ACID compliance
  - Familiar SQL interface
  - Rich ecosystem of tools
```

### 6.2 Business Considerations
```yaml
dynamodb_benefits:
  - Faster time to market
  - Reduced operational complexity
  - Better suited for microservices
  - Pay-per-request model

postgresql_benefits:
  - Better data analytics support
  - Easier integration with BI tools
  - More familiar to existing team
  - Complex transaction support
```

## 7. Recommendation

Based on the cost analysis and our specific requirements:

1. **Short-term (Year 1)**: DynamoDB with on-demand pricing provides the lowest initial cost and fastest time to market.

2. **Long-term (Years 2-3)**: PostgreSQL becomes more cost-effective as the application matures and requires more complex queries and analytics.

3. **Migration Timeline**: Plan migration to PostgreSQL when:
   - Query patterns become more complex
   - Analytics requirements increase
   - Team has bandwidth for migration
   - Cost savings justify the migration effort

This analysis suggests starting with DynamoDB and migrating to PostgreSQL as the application matures and requirements evolve.
