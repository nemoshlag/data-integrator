```

### Priority Tasks
1. Create patient monitoring dashboard
2. Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
3. Add filtering and sorting capabilities
4. Implement alert notifications
5. UI/UX testing

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Core Monitoring Functionality
```python
# Key monitoring query performance targets
MONITORING_QUERY_TIME = 100  # milliseconds
REALTIME_UPDATE_LATENCY = 500  # milliseconds
MAX_BATCH_PROCESSING_TIME = 1000  # milliseconds
```

### 2. Data Processing Performance
```python
# Processing targets
MAX_PROCESSING_DELAY = 5  # seconds
BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # records
MAX_MEMORY_USAGE = 512  # MB
```

### 3. System Reliability
```python
# Reliability targets
UPTIME_TARGET = 99.9  # percent
MAX_ERROR_RATE = 0.1  # percent
DATA_CONSISTENCY_CHECK_INTERVAL = 300  # seconds
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Database operations
- Data processing logic
- API endpoints
- Frontend components

### 2. Integration Tests
- End-to-end data flow
- WebSocket functionality
- Alert generation
- Real-time updates

### 3. Performance Tests
- Query response times
- Data processing throughput
- WebSocket scalability
- Frontend responsiveness

## Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. System Health
```yaml
Metrics:
  - Database response time
  - API latency
  - WebSocket connections
  - Error rates

Alerts:
  - High latency (>500ms)
  - Error rate spike (>1%)
  - Processing delays (>10s)
  - Database connection issues
```

### 2. Business Metrics
```yaml
Metrics:
  - Patients without tests >48h
  - Average test interval
  - Processing backlog
  - Alert response time

Alerts:
  - Critical patient count increase
  - Processing pipeline delays
  - Data consistency issues
  - System capacity warnings
```
