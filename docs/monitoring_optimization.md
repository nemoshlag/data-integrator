```

## Database Optimizations

### 1. Denormalized Test Date Tracking
```sql
-- Add last_test_date to admissions table for direct access
ALTER TABLE admissions
ADD COLUMN last_test_date TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN hours_since_test INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS 
    (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_test_date))/3600) STORED;

-- Update trigger to maintain last_test_date
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_admission_last_test()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE admissions
    SET last_test_date = NEW.test_date
    WHERE admission_id = NEW.admission_id
    AND (last_test_date IS NULL OR NEW.test_date > last_test_date);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_update_last_test
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON lab_tests
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_admission_last_test();
```

### 2. Materialized View for Monitoring
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_patients_needing_tests AS
SELECT 
    p.patient_id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    a.admission_id,
    a.ward,
    a.admission_date,
    a.last_test_date,
    a.hours_since_test
FROM 
    patients p
    JOIN admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
WHERE 
    a.status = 'Active'
    AND (a.last_test_date IS NULL 
        OR a.hours_since_test > 48);

-- Index for efficient retrieval
CREATE INDEX idx_hours_since_test 
ON admissions(hours_since_test) 
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### 3. Real-time Monitoring Queue
```sql
-- Priority queue table for monitoring
CREATE TABLE monitoring_queue (
    patient_id VARCHAR(50),
    admission_id VARCHAR(50),
    hours_since_test INTEGER,
    priority INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        CASE 
            WHEN hours_since_test >= 48 THEN 1
            WHEN hours_since_test >= 36 THEN 2
            ELSE 3
        END
    ) STORED,
    last_checked TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (patient_id, admission_id)
);

-- Index for priority-based querying
CREATE INDEX idx_monitoring_priority 
ON monitoring_queue(priority, hours_since_test DESC);
```

## Query Optimization

### 1. Efficient Monitoring Query
```sql
-- Optimized query using indexes
SELECT 
    p.patient_id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    a.ward,
    a.hours_since_test
FROM 
    admissions a
    JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
WHERE 
    a.status = 'Active'
    AND a.hours_since_test >= 48
ORDER BY 
    a.hours_since_test DESC;
```

### 2. Batch Processing Strategy
```python
def process_monitoring_batch():
    """Process patients in batches for monitoring."""
    with get_db() as db:
        # Get batch of patients to check
        patients = db.execute("""
            SELECT patient_id, admission_id, hours_since_test
            FROM monitoring_queue
            WHERE priority = 1
            ORDER BY hours_since_test DESC
            LIMIT 100
            FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        """)
        
        for patient in patients:
            check_patient_status(patient)
            update_last_checked(patient)
```

## Performance Impact Analysis

### 1. Query Performance
```plaintext
Before Optimization:
- Complex joins and calculations at query time
- Variable performance based on data volume
- Heavy database load

After Optimization:
- Pre-calculated hours_since_test
- Indexed access to priority patients
- Consistent sub-100ms response time
```

### 2. Resource Usage
```plaintext
Memory Usage:
- Materialized view: ~100MB for 10k active patients
- Monitoring queue: ~10MB
- Index size: ~50MB

CPU Impact:
- Minimal for regular queries
- Moderate for view refresh
- Low for trigger operations
```

## Scaling Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Materialized view can be replicated
- Read queries distributed across replicas
- Write operations on primary only

### 2. Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- Partition monitoring_queue for better performance
CREATE TABLE monitoring_queue (
    patient_id VARCHAR(50),
    admission_id VARCHAR(50),
    hours_since_test INTEGER,
    priority INTEGER,
    last_checked TIMESTAMP
) PARTITION BY LIST (priority);

-- Create partitions for different priorities
CREATE TABLE monitoring_queue_critical 
    PARTITION OF monitoring_queue FOR VALUES IN (1);
CREATE TABLE monitoring_queue_warning 
    PARTITION OF monitoring_queue FOR VALUES IN (2);
CREATE TABLE monitoring_queue_normal 
    PARTITION OF monitoring_queue FOR VALUES IN (3);
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Monitor query performance
CREATE VIEW v_monitoring_performance AS
SELECT 
    date_trunc('hour', query_start) as hour,
    count(*) as query_count,
    avg(extract(epoch from (query_end - query_start))) as avg_duration,
    max(extract(epoch from (query_end - query_start))) as max_duration
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE query LIKE '%monitoring_queue%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

### 2. Alert Thresholds
```python
def check_monitoring_performance():
    """Monitor system performance metrics."""
    with get_db() as db:
        metrics = db.execute("""
            SELECT 
                count(*) as queue_size,
                max(hours_since_test) as max_hours,
                avg(hours_since_test) as avg_hours
            FROM monitoring_queue
            WHERE priority = 1
        """)
        
        if metrics.queue_size > 1000:
            alert_high_queue_size(metrics)
        if metrics.max_hours > 72:
            alert_critical_delay(metrics)
```

## Conclusion

The 48-hour monitoring requirement has led to specific optimizations that:
1. Minimize query complexity
2. Ensure consistent performance
3. Enable real-time monitoring
4. Support system scalability

These optimizations make the monitoring system more:
- Reliable
- Performant
- Maintainable
- Scalable
